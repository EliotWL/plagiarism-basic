                        in mathematics and computer science dynamic programming is a method of solving problems that exhibit the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure

                        described below the method takes much less time than naive methods the term was originally used in the 1940s by richard bellman to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another by 1953 he had refined this to the modern meaning the field was founded as a systems analysis and engineering topic that is recognized by the ieee bellman s contribution is remembered in the name of the bellman equation a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in recursive form

                        
                    
                        
                            <strong>
                        

                        the word programming in dynamic programming has no particular connection to computer programming at all and instead comes from the term mathematical programming a synonym for optimization

                        thus the program is the optimal plan for action that is produced for instance a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program

                        
                    
                        
                            <strong>
                        

                        programming in this sense means finding an acceptable plan of action an algorithm optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem

                        for example the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph can be found by first computing the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices and then using this to pick the best overall path as shown in figure 1

                        in general we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three step process 1 break the problem into smaller subproblems 2 solve these problems optimally using this three step process recursively 3 use these optimal solutions to construct an optimal solution for the original problem the subproblems are themselves solved by dividing them into sub subproblems and so on until we reach some simple case that is solvable in constant time

                        figure 2 the subproblem graph for the fibonacci sequence that it is not a tree but a dag indicates overlapping subproblems

                        to say that a problem has overlapping subproblems is to say that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems for example in the fibonacci sequence f3 f1 f2 and f4 f2 f3 computing each number involves computing f2 because both f3 and f4 are needed to compute f5 a naive approach to computing f5 may end up computing f2 twice or more this applies whenever overlapping subproblems are present a naive approach may waste time recomputing optimal solutions to subproblems it has already solved in order to avoid this we instead save the solutions to problems we have already solved then if we need to solve the same problem later we can retrieve and reuse our already computed solution

                        dynamic programming usually takes one of two approaches the top down approach the problem is broken into sub problems and these sub problems are solved and the solutions remembered in case they need to be solved again this is recursion and memorization combined together and the bottom up approach all sub problems that might be needed are solved in advance and then used to build up solutions to larger problems this approach is slightly better in stack space and number of function calls but it is sometimes not intuitive to figure out all the sub problems needed for solving the given problem some programming languages can automatically memorize the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments in order to speed up call by name some languages make it possible portably e g scheme common lisp or perl some need special extensions this is only possible for a referentially transparent function

                        in object oriented programming inheritance is a way to form new classes instances of which are called objects using classes that have already been defined

                        an advantage of inheritance is that modules with sufficiently similar interfaces can share a lot of code reducing the complexity of the program inheritance therefore has another view a dual called polymorphism which describes many pieces of code being controlled by shared control code

                        dynamic programming is a method of solving problems that exhibit the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure the term was originally used in the 1940s by richard bellman the word programming in dynamic programming has no particular connection to computer programming at all and instead comes from the term mathematical programming a synonym for optimization the program is the optimal plan for action that is produced for instance a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program programming in this sense means finding an acceptable plan of action to say that a problem has overlapping subproblems is to say that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem

                        optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem for example the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph can be found by first computing the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices and then using this to pick the best overall path as shown in figure 1 in general we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three step process 1 break the problem into smaller subproblems 2 solve these problems optimally using this three step process recursively 3 use these optimal solutions to construct an optimal solution for the original problem the subproblems are themselves solved by dividing them into sub subproblems and so on until we reach some simple case that is solvable in constant time figure 2 the subproblem graph for the fibonacci sequence that it is not a tree but a dag indicates overlapping subproblems to say that a problem has overlapping subproblems is to say that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems for example in the fibonacci sequence f3 f1 f2 and f4 f2 f3 computing each number involves computing f2 because both f3 and f4 are needed to compute f5 a naive approach to computing f5 may end up computing f2 twice or more this applies whenever overlapping subproblems are present a naive approach may waste time recomputing optimal solutions to subproblems it has already solved in order to avoid this we instead save the solutions to problems we have already solved then if we need to solve the same problem later we can retrieve and reuse our already computed solution this approach is called memoization not memorization although this term also fits if we are sure we won t need a particular solution anymore we can throw it away to save space in some cases we can even compute the solutions to subproblems we know that we ll need in advance

                        the word programming in dynamic programming has no particular connection to computer programming at all and instead comes from the term mathematical programming a synonym for optimization thus the program is the optimal plan for action that is produced for instance a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program programming in this sense means finding an acceptable plan of action an algorithm

                        dynamic programming usually takes one of two approaches the top down approach the problem is broken into sub problems and these sub problems are solved and the solutions remembered in case they need to be solved again this is recursion and memorization combined together and the bottom up approach all sub problems that might be needed are solved in advance and then used to build up solutions to larger problems this approach is slightly better in stack space and number of function calls but it is sometimes not intuitive to figure out all the sub problems needed for solving the given problem some programming languages can automatically memorize the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments in order to speed up call by name some languages make it possible portably e g scheme common lisp or perl some need special extensions this is only possible for a referentially transparent function

                        optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem for example the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph can be found by first computing the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices and then using this to pick the best overall path in general we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three step process 1 break the problem into smaller subproblems 2 solve these problems optimally using this three step process recursively 3 use these optimal solutions to construct an optimal solution for the original problem the subproblems are themselves solved by dividing them into sub subproblems and so on until we reach some simple case that is solvable in constant time

                        dynamic programming usually takes one of two approaches the top down approach the problem is broken into sub problems and these sub problems are solved and the solutions remembered in case they need to be solved again this is recursion and memorization combined together and the bottom up approach all sub problems that might be needed are solved in advance and then used to build up solutions to larger problems this approach is slightly better in stack space and number of function calls but it is sometimes not intuitive to figure out all the sub problems needed for solving the given problem some programming languages can automatically memorize the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments in order to speed up call by name some languages make it possible portably e g scheme common lisp or perl some need special extensions this is only possible for a referentially transparent function

                        to say that a problem has overlapping subproblems is to say that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem

                        an algorithm dynamic programming usually takes one of two approaches the top down approach the problem is broken into sub problems and these sub problems are solved and the solutions remembered in case they need to be solved again this is recursion and memorization combined together and the bottom up approach all sub problems that might be needed are solved in advance and then used to build up solutions to larger problems this approach is slightly better in stack space and number of function calls but it is sometimes not intuitive to figure out all the sub problems needed for solving the given problem some programming languages can automatically memorize the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments in order to speed up call by name some languages make it possible portably e g scheme common lisp or perl some need special extensions this is only possible for a referentially transparent function

                        applications of bayes theorem often assume the philosophy underlying bayesian probability that uncertainty and degrees of belief can be measured as probabilities one of bayes results proposition 5 gives a simple description of conditional probability and shows that it can be expressed independently of the order in which things occur if there be two subsequent events the probability of the second b n and the probability of both together p n and it being first discovered that the second event has also happened from hence i guess that the first event has also happened the probability i am right i e the conditional probability of the first event being true given that the second has also happened is p b note that the expression says nothing about the order in which the events occurred it measures correlation not causation

                        programming in this sense means finding an acceptable plan of action an algorithm dynamic programming usually takes one of two approaches the top down approach the problem is broken into sub problems and these sub problems are solved and the solutions remembered in case they need to be solved again this is recursion and memorization combined together and the bottom up approach all sub problems that might be needed are solved in advance and then used to build up solutions to larger problems this approach is slightly better in stack space and number of function calls but it is sometimes not intuitive to figure out all the sub problems needed for solving the given problem some programming languages can automatically memorize the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments in order to speed up call by name some languages make it possible portably e g scheme common lisp or perl some need special extensions this is only possible for a referentially transparent function

                        in mathematics and computer science dynamic programming is a method of solving problems that exhibit the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure described below the method takes much less time than naive methods the term was originally used in the 1940s by richard bellman to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another by 1953 he had refined this to the modern meaning the field was founded as a systems analysis and engineering topic that is recognized by the ieee bellman s contribution is remembered in the name of the bellman equation a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in recursive form the word programming in dynamic programming has no particular connection to computer programming at all and instead comes from the term mathematical programming a synonym for optimization thus the program is the optimal plan for action that is produced for instance a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program programming in this sense means finding an acceptable plan of action an algorithm optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem for example the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph can be found by first computing the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices and then using this to pick the best overall path as shown in figure 1 in general we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three step process 1 break the problem into smaller subproblems 2 solve these problems optimally using this three step process recursively 3 use these optimal solutions to construct an optimal solution for the original problem

                        optimal plan for action that is produced for instance a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program programming in this sense means finding an acceptable plan of action an algorithm optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem for example the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph can be found by first computing the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices and then using this to pick the best overall path as shown in figure 1 in general we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three step process 1 break the problem into smaller subproblems 2 solve these problems optimally using this three step process recursively 3 use these optimal solutions to construct an optimal solution for the original problem the subproblems are themselves solved by dividing them into sub subproblems and so on until we reach some simple case that is solvable in constant time figure 2 the subproblem graph for the fibonacci sequence that it is not a tree but a dag indicates overlapping subproblems to say that a problem has overlapping subproblems is to say that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems for example in the fibonacci sequence f3 f1 f2 and f4 f2 f3 computing each number involves computing f2 because both f3 and f4 are needed to compute f5 a naive approach to computing f5 may end up computing f2 twice or more this applies whenever overlapping subproblems are present a naive approach may waste time recomputing optimal solutions to subproblems it has already solved in order to avoid this we instead save the solutions to problems we have already solved then if we need to solve the same problem later we can retrieve and reuse our already computed solution this approach is called memoization not memorization although this term also fits if we are sure we won t need a particular solution anymore we can throw it away to save space in some cases we can even compute the solutions to subproblems we know that we ll need in advance

                        applications of bayes theorem often assume the philosophy underlying bayesian probability that uncertainty and degrees of belief can be measured as probabilities one of bayes results proposition 5 gives a simple description of conditional probability and shows that it can be expressed independently of the order in which things occur if there be two subsequent events the probability of the second b n and the probability of both together p n and it being first discovered that the second event has also happened from hence i guess that the first event has also happened the probability i am right i e the conditional probability of the first event being true given that the second has also happened is p b note that the expression says nothing about the order in which the events occurred it measures correlation not causation

                        dynamic programming usually takes one of two approaches the top down approach the problem is broken into sub problems and these sub problems are solved and the solutions remembered in case they need to be solved again this is recursion and memorization combined together and the bottom up approach all sub problems that might be needed are solved in advance and then used to build up solutions to larger problems this approach is slightly better in stack space and number of function calls but it is sometimes not intuitive to figure out all the sub problems needed for solving the given problem some programming languages can automatically memorize the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments in order to speed up call by name some languages make it possible portably e g scheme common lisp or perl some need special extensions this is only possible for a referentially transparent function

                        optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem in general we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three step process 1 break the problem into smaller subproblems 2 solve these problems optimally using this three step process recursively 3 use these optimal solutions to construct an optimal solution for the original problem the subproblems are themselves solved by dividing them into sub subproblems and so on until we reach some simple case that is solvable in constant time to say that a problem has overlapping subproblems is to say that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems for example in the fibonacci sequence f3 f1 f2 and f4 f2 f3 computing each number involves computing f2 because both f3 and f4 are needed to compute f5 a naive approach to computing f5 may end up computing f2 twice or more this applies whenever overlapping subproblems are present a naive approach may waste time recomputing optimal solutions to subproblems it has already solved in order to avoid this we instead save the solutions to problems we have already solved then if we need to solve the same problem later we can retrieve and reuse our already computed solution if we are sure we won t need a particular solution anymore we can throw it away to save space in some cases we can even compute the solutions to subproblems we know that we ll need in advance dynamic programming makes use of overlapping subproblems optimal substructure memoization dynamic programming usually takes one of two approaches top down approach bottom up approach

                        optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem in general we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three step process 1 break the problem into smaller subproblems 2 solve these problems optimally using this three step process recursively 3 use these optimal solutions to construct an optimal solution for the original problem the subproblems are themselves solved by dividing them into sub subproblems and so on until we reach some simple case that is solvable in constant time to say that a problem has overlapping subproblems is to say that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems for example in the fibonacci sequence f3 f1 f2 and f4 f2 f3 computing each number involves computing f2 because both f3 and f4 are needed to compute f5 a naive approach to computing f5 may end up computing f2 twice or more this applies whenever overlapping subproblems are present a naive approach may waste time recomputing optimal solutions to subproblems it has already solved in order to avoid this we instead save the solutions to problems we have already solved then if we need to solve the same problem later we can retrieve and reuse our already computed solution if we are sure we won t need a particular solution anymore we can throw it away to save space in some cases we can even compute the solutions to subproblems we know that we ll need in advance dynamic programming makes use of overlapping subproblems optimal substructure memoization dynamic programming usually takes one of two approaches top down approach bottom up approach

                        applications of bayes theorem often assume the philosophy underlying bayesian probability that uncertainty and degrees of belief can be measured as probabilities one of bayes results proposition 5 gives a simple description of conditional probability and shows that it can be expressed independently of the order in which things occur if there be two subsequent events the probability of the second b n and the probability of both together p n and it being first discovered that the second event has also happened from hence i guess that the first event has also happened the probability i am right i e the conditional probability of the first event being true given that the second has also happened is p b note that the expression says nothing about the order in which the events occurred it measures correlation not causation

                        in mathematics and computer science dynamic programming is a method of solving problems that exhibit the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure the method takes much less time than naive methods the term was originally used in the 1940s to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another

                        dynamic programming is a method of providing solutions to potential problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping sub problems and optimal structure this is highly used in dynamic programming the advantage being the less time consumption in comparison to other amateur methods it has to be kept in mind that the term programming in the field has got nothing to do with computer programming at all on the other hand it is derived from the term mathematical programming which is a similar word used for optimization here by meaning that a program can be an optimal plan for the produced action the typical example could be of a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition this leads to the concept of programming being a helper in finding an acceptable plan of action which can also be termed as an algorithm

                        overlapping subproblems means that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems example could be of fibonacci sequence f3 f1 f2 and f4 f2 f3 computing each number involves computing f2 because both f3 and f4 are needed to compute f5 a naive approach to computing f5 may end up computing f2 twice or more it means that whenever we encounter with overlapping subproblems a naive approach may waste to e recomputing optimal solutions to the already solved subproblems

                        and then using this to pick the best overall path as shown in figure 1 in general we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three step process 1 break the problem into smaller subproblems 2 solve these problems optimally using this three step process recursively 3 use these optimal solutions to construct an optimal solution for the original problem the subproblems are themselves solved by dividing them into sub subproblems and so on until we reach some simple case that is solvable in constant time figure 2 the subproblem graph for the fibonacci sequence that it is not a tree but a dag indicates overlapping subproblems to say that a problem has overlapping subproblems is to say that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems for example in the fibonacci sequence f3 f1 f2 and f4 f2 f3 computing each number involves computing f2 because both f3 and f4 are needed to compute f5 a naive approach to computing f5 may end up computing f2 twice or more this applies whenever overlapping subproblems are present a naive approach may waste time recomputing optimal solutions to subproblems it has already solved in order to avoid this we instead save the solutions to problems we have already solved then if we need to solve the same problem later we can retrieve and reuse our already computed solution this approach is called memoization not memorization although this term also fits if we are sure we won t need a particular solution anymore we can throw it away to save space in some cases we can even compute the solutions to subproblems we know that we ll need in advance

                        one example is the computing of the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph first compute the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices then using this the best overall path can be found thereby demonstrating the dynamic programming principle this general three step process can be used to solve a problem 1 break up the problem different smaller subproblems 2 recursively use this three step process to compute the optimal path in the subproblem 3 construct an optimal solution using the computed optimal subproblems for the original problem this process continues recursively working over the subproblems by dividing them into sub subproblems and so forth until a simple case is reached one that is easily solvable

                        in general we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three step process 1 break the problem into smaller subproblems 2 solve these problems optimally using this three step process recursively 3 use these optimal solutions to construct an optimal solution for the original problem the subproblems are themselves solved by dividing them into sub subproblems and so on until we reach some simple case that is solvable in constant time to say that a problem has overlapping subproblems is to say that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems for example in the fibonacci sequence f3 f1 f2 and f4 f2 f3 computing each number involves computing f2 because both f3 and f4 are needed to compute f5 a naive approach to computing f5 may end up computing f2 twice or more this applies whenever overlapping subproblems are present a naive approach may waste time recomputing optimal solutions to subproblems it has already solved in order to avoid this we instead save the solutions to problems we have already solved then if we need to solve the same problem later we can retrieve and reuse our already computed solution if we are sure we won t need a particular solution anymore we can throw it away to save space in some cases we can even compute the solutions to subproblems we know that we ll need in advance dynamic programming makes use of overlapping subproblems optimal substructure memoization dynamic programming usually takes one of two approaches top down approach bottom up approach

                        inheritance is a method of forming new classes using predefined classes the new classes are called derived classes and they inherit the behaviours and attributes of the base classes it was intended to allow existing code to be used again with minimal or no alteration it also offers support for representation by categorization in computer languages this is a powerful mechanism of information processing vital to human learning by means of generalization and cognitive economy inheritance is occasionally referred to as generalization due to the fact that

                        dynamic programming dp is in basic terms an algorithm design technique that is used for optimization problems and often involves minimizing or maximizing furthermore by combining solutions to subproblems dp solves problems subproblems may include and contain many other subsubproblems and even in such cases the solution to one subproblem may not affect the solutions to other subproblems involved in the same problem by solving subproblems in a bottom up fashion which is basically when storing

                        and looking up to find the solution when a subproblem is come across once more this would cause dp to reduce computations the following is a generalization path to be taken in dynamic programming firstly it is needed to characterize the structure of an optimal solution secondly to define the value of the optimal solution recursively furthermore to compute the optimal solution values either by following a top down method with caching or a bottom up method in a table the last point would be to construct an optimal solution from the computed values

                        except for some particularities there are examples where we can have modules with similar interfaces the advantage that inheritance provides is that it makes such modules share a lot of code which consequently reduces the complexity of the program

                        program programming in this sense means finding an acceptable plan of action an algorithm dynamic programming usually takes one of two approaches the top down approach the problem is broken into sub problems and these sub problems are solved and the solutions remembered in case they need to be solved again this is recursion and memorization combined together and the bottom up approach all sub problems that might be needed are solved in advance and then used to build up solutions to larger problems this approach is slightly better in stack space and number of function calls but it is sometimes not intuitive to figure out all the sub problems needed for solving the given problem some programming languages can automatically memorize the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments in order to speed up call by name some languages make it possible portably e g scheme common lisp or perl some need special extensions this is only possible for a referentially transparent function

                        inheritance is a method of forming new classes using predefined classes the new classes are called derived classes and they inherit the behaviours and attributes of the base classes it was intended to allow existing code to be used again with minimal or no alteration it also offers support for representation by categorization in computer languages this is a powerful mechanism of information processing vital to human learning by means of generalization and cognitive economy inheritance is occasionally referred to as generalization due to the fact that
